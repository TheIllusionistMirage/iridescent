# Iridescent

A simple, proof of concept, cross platform, 2D isometric game engine written in
C++, using OpenGL.

**P.S.** This is a WIP and in a very rudimentary stage right now. Most of what
I've written below exists only as a blob in my head.

# Why?

## TL;DR version

Mah lyf, mah rulzZ :sunglasses:

## TL;R version

I wanted to do a farily complex software development project in the *right*
way, i.e., understanding how 2D game engines work, getting to know popular
strategies of doing specific stuff like memory pooling, message passing for
communication between components, etc., and most importantly, get a chance
to use design patterns in real life. I also wanted to expand my command on
C, C++ and STL along with my knowledge on data structures and algorithms.

# How?

I'm using C++ for the core engine, along with Lua for realizing the runtime
stuff like the ECS system and scritps.

# Engine Design & Architecture

I'm working on it.
